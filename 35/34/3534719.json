{"forum": {"content": "HI all,<br />First thanks to all of you who help me learn English before. However, I have a question about setence structure when I listened to English magazine. So please help me again, thanks.<br /><br />the setence:<br />\"I ask him how different his life would have been had he been exposed to a gruop like SAY as a kid.\"<br /><br />I am confused by the structure of above setence. Since there should be one verb, I think \"ask\" us that one. As the result, the follows \"how...kid\" is a clause. But I am familiar with this style of structure.<br /><br />is it interpreted by the following way: [how different his life would have been] [had] [he been......] <br /><br />had \u662f\u4f7f\u5f79\u52d5\u8a5e\uff0c\u62ff\u4f86\u4fee\u98fe\u5f8c\u9762\u7684\u53e5\u5b50(\u76ee\u524d\u770b\u8d77\u4f86\u6bd4\u8f03\u50cf\u9019\u6a23)\uff0c\u9084\u662f\u4f5c\u70ba\u5012\u88dd\u53e5\u4f86\u4f7f\u7528(\u662f\u8aaa\u6211\u4e5f\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u9019\u908a\u70ba\u4ec0\u9ebc\u80fd\u7528\u5012\u88dd\u53e5\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u524d\u9762\u6709\u9ede\u8207\u4e8b\u5be6\u4e0d\u7b26\uff1f)<br /><br />\u4f46\u5982\u679chad\u662f\u4f7f\u5f79\u52d5\u8a5e\uff0c\u5f8c\u9762\u61c9\u8a72\u8981\u63a5\u539f\u578bbe\u5427\uff1f\u6240\u4ee5\u770b\u8d77\u4f86\u6bd4\u8f03\u50cf\u5012\u88dd\u53e5\uff1f<br /><br />Anyway, I am completely confused by this setence.

{"forum": {"content": "what's up boys and girls! I am looking for a language partner to practice and keep my <br />English speaking sharp. People with any level of English proficiency are welcome as long as you have your mind set on improving your English and are fun to talk with. But I do prefer someone close to my age(22-35) so we will have more common subjects to talk about. I am a 29 y/o male from New Taipei City. We can both chat or talk on the phone but I'd rather talk because I believe we can all agree that when it comes to language acquisition, speaking is the most crucial skill and also what most Taiwanese English learners lack of. So don't be shy, add me up and let's get to know each other.", "images": ["http://filestoresg1.beetalkmobile.com:8081/file/9e0493423e5ae7bb4f0b9830f017d712"], "urls": [], "title": "Language partner wanted"}, "threadStatus": 0, "regionId": 886, "barStatus": 0, "barId": 724, "postBy": {"utc": 1458808395000, "level": 2, "location": "New Taipei City\u00b7Taiwan", "avatar": "http://filestoresg1.beetalkmobile.com:8081/file/-2887115208625814526", "name": "Andrew"}, "id": 3368561}

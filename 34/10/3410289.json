{"forum": {"content": "Greetings from Japan!  I was luckily allowed to join this group though I don't live in the fair city.  Thank you so much.  I have been searching for a woman doctor from Taiwan who had lost her life in my city by US air raid on August 10, 1945, just five days before the end of the Pacific War.  In the air raid, some 50 people were killed and most of their names are known to commemorate them.  But the doctor's name and related information except her surname were unknown.  I happened to find a possible family who had something to do with the doctor.  Here is the link to the information; http://blog.xuite.net/wu20130902/wu20130902/209879928-%E7%94%9F%E7%94%9F%E9%86%AB%E9%99%A2%E9%86%AB%E5%B8%AB%3A%E8%94%A1%E8%A3%95%E7%A6%8F<br />I think the first daughter, \u8521\u78a7\u96f2\u3000might be the doctor.  I would appreciate it if you would give me any information on the family and the daughter.  Thank you for your understanding and help.", "images": ["http://filestoresg1.beetalkmobile.com:8081/file/eed540a8d1f4fa97747ddbf1449423e7"], "urls": [], "title": "\u4f86\u81ea\u65e5\u672c\u7684\u5c0b\u4eba\u555f\u4e8b"}, "threadStatus": 0, "regionId": 886, "barStatus": 0, "barId": 674, "postBy": {"utc": 1459332197000, "level": 1, "location": "\u53f0\u4e2d\u5e02\u00b7\u53f0\u7063", "avatar": "http://filestoresg1.beetalkmobile.com:8081/file/-6153415708949157470", "name": "Jay"}, "id": 3410289}
